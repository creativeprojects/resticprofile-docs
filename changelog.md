# v0.30.0 (2025-04-04)

## 🌱 Spring release 🌸

This release introduces features and fixes for profile scheduling.

### ⚠️ Breaking change

Until this release, the `user` scheduling permission was broken. With `systemd` or the default macOS scheduler, the permission functioned as `user_logged_on`, running the profile only when the user was logged in.

This issue is now fixed for new schedules.

To update existing schedules, run `unschedule` and then `schedule` again.

For `systemd`, resticprofile requires root privileges (via sudo) to schedule with `user` permission, as it now uses a system unit running as the user.

### Scheduler

Scheduling has been significantly improved with the ability to read existing schedules. The `status` and `unschedule` commands now detect any resticprofile schedules from the selected configuration file, even if the profile is no longer present.

Due to recent error reports, Windows Task Scheduler integration has been completely rewritten to use the `schtasks` CLI tool.

### Other

- Fixed issue with non-existent battery reported on recent Mac desktop hardware.  
- Added support for Restic 0.18.  
- Included pre-built binary for Windows on ARM64.  
- Upload Resticprofile container to GitHub Container Registry.

# v0.27.0 (2024-06-27)

## 🌻 Summer release 🌞

Summer is here in the Northern Hemisphere! A new release is here too! 🎉

A lot of goodies in this release:

### new run-schedule command

It's more a _behind the scene_ feature: you no longer need to re-schedule your targets after you changed the configuration. The generated schedule command line is now using this new `run-schedule` command that reads all the newest bits from the configuration.

You might want to `unschedule` and `schedule` all your profiles one last time to replace the existing command line using the new `run-schedule` command.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/commands/index.html#run-schedule-command

### direct support for crontab files

Previously resticprofile was using the `crontab` tool to read and write `crond` schedules. Now you can directly setup a `crontab` file no matter which tool is going to consume it.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/index.html

### keep content of configuration variables between commands

This was a big issue for some time. The wait is over! You can now set a configuration variable anywhere in a script and use its value later.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/run_hooks/index.html#passing-environment-variables

### "RESTICPROFILE_{FLAGNAME}" env vars

All cli flags can now be set using environment variables.

More information: [#334](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/issues/334)

### allow controlling command output redirection

Allow redirection of the console messages to a log file or to syslog.

More information: [#343](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/343)

### Add "--stderr" to redirect console to stderr (for "cat" and "dump")

More information: https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/353

### Add option to set working directory for restic backup

More information: https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/354

# v0.26.0 (2024-02-20)

## 🦆 Second time lucky February release 🚀 

🆕 A lot of pre-built binaries have been added on this release. This is to align with the list of pre-built binaries provided by `restic`

Otherwise this is mostly a maintenance release with a few fixes:
- fixes multiple backup profiles exporting prometheus files to `node_exporter`
- fix missing fields in the `show` command
- weekly docker image build (rebuilt under the same version tag, and as `latest`)
- restrict the `copy` command to a list of snapshots in the configuration

## Changelog
* [Add pre-built binary targets to release pipeline (#324)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/2ab1f3a)
* [Add prometheus label to build info (#319)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/233e4b8)

# v0.25.0 (2024-02-08)

## 💖 February release 💝

### ⚠️ Potential breaking change

The prometheus library used to send metrics to the proxy using `protobuf`.
By default it's now using the more widely used `text` format.

If you have any issue sending metrics to your proxy, you can revert to the previous behaviour by adding this option to your profile (it's **not** a global option)

```yaml
my_profile:
  prometheus-push-format: protobuf
```

More information about the different formats: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#exposition-formats


## New in this version
* fix for CVE-2023-48795
* new option `prometheus-push-format` with values `text` or `protobuf` (#281)
* new option to set log output in `global` section (#277)
* more control over the default systemd service files (#267)
* and bug fixes!

# v0.22.0 (2023-05-06)

## ⚠️  Breaking change

The default value of the `job` tag on prometheus gateway push has changed from `command` to `profile.command`.
But don't worry: you can easily revert back to the original value by adding this option in your configuration:

```yaml
prometheus-push-job: "${COMMAND}"
```

## Fixes:
* Complicated scheduling on Windows was sometimes setting up a random delay before starting a job

# v0.21.1 (2023-04-05)

## Bug fixes!

This small release fixes two regression bugs introduced in version `0.21.0`
- the `~` was no longer replaced by the user's home directory for some flag (`repository` and others...)
- environment variables were no longer replaced by their value for some flag (`repository` and others...)

Thanks @jkellerer for the quick fixes 😉 👍🏻 

## New features from `v0.21.0`
This release adds a verification of all the flags permitted by restic. Only the flags compatible with your version of restic will be generated (prior to this version, any flag like `unknown-flag` would end up on the restic command line as `--unknown-flag`.

Also this version generates a JSON schema: this is the configuration schema which can auto-complete options, and verify that your configuration is correct. It works with any compatible editor for the JSON, TOML and YAML configuration file format. Thanks @jkellerer for the awesome work on this 🎉 . [More information here](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/jsonschema/index.html).

Other nice feature is the introduction of the `help` command which works for both all the **resticprofile** and **restic** commands and flags. Try it out!

## Changelog
* [Fix #187: homedir/env-vars in repo and other flags (#188)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/487db0b)
* [Fix #189: completion of own commands (#190)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/b78d1a0)
* [Updated clog to 0.13 (#191)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/b6a98ef)

## Docker images

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.16.0`


# v0.15.0 (2021-08-29)

## ⚠️ Important

Version 0.15 fixed some issues with escaping parameters to the restic command line. **If you've used any of these characters in file or directory names in your configuration, please make sure your backup is still working as expected:** `space`, `*`, `?`, `\`, `[`, `'`, `"`.

If for some reason the fix broke your configuration, there's a new flag `legacy-arguments` that you can activate in the `global` section to revert back to the broken implementation:

```yaml
global:
    legacy-arguments: true
```

## New features in 0.15:
- add `.Hostname` in configuration template (#55)
- add description field in profile section
- add support for prometheus file export and push gateway
- hide confidential values in output (#58)
- add `.TmpDir` variable to configuration template (#62)

## This version also includes fixes for:
- resolving special paths starting with a `~` (unixes only)
- warn when the restic binary was not found at the specified location (but still found at a different location)
- resolve glob expressions in backup sources (#63)

## Changelog

* [Add support for prometheus export and push (#57)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/abf0b00)
* [Added "{{.TmpDir}}" to TemplateData (#62)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/37a69d7)

## Docker images

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.15.0`


# v0.14.1 (2021-06-23)

## Bug fix release

This release changes the way the restic binary is searched:
- restic binary path in `global` configuration can now contain the `~` character like `~restic/bin/restic`
- if you specified a path in the `global` configuration and it cannot find the file, a warning will be displayed and resticprofile will keep trying to find a suitable binary

## Changelog

* [use shell to resolve special paths with ~](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/4686dd2)

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.11.0`


# v0.10.1 (2020-11-17)

This update changes the way systemd units are generated:
These used to be of type `oneshot` but it means they can be started more than once.
They have been changed to `notify` which is like `simple` but resticprofile is notifying systemd that the schedule has started and stopped.

To change the type on your existing schedules, you'll need to run the commands `unschedule` and `schedule` again.

## Changelog

* [change systemd unit to "notify"](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/ba711f2)
* [update packages verify self-update binary using checksums.txt file](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/9f2edb8)
* [update restic to 0.11.0 in docker image](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/cff661b)




# v0.10.0 (2020-11-12)

New resticprofile version with bug fixes and a big new feature:
- fix --exclude and --iexclude parameters in unix environment not properly escaping `?` and `*` characters
- don't escape ` ` (space) if already escaped
- self-update now works on ARM CPUs (like raspberry pi)
- configuration files can embed Go templates for modularity

I think it is now feature complete for a version 1.0 😄 

## Changelog

* [Escape `exclude` globs passed to `/sh`](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/e2047e0)

# v0.7.1 (2020-06-25)

This a maintenance release:
- add a new parameter `run-after-fail` which is running the shell commands after any kind of failure (during other commands or during restic execution)
- a minor breaking change if you use the repository auto-initialization, it will now run **after** the `run-before` scripts. It makes more sense this way (in case you mount your backup disks in `run-before` for example)

## Changelog

* [add raspberry pi to supported platforms](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/2321bf9)
* [add run-after-fail parameter to run shell commands after a restic command failed. the auto initialization of a repository now happens after the "run-before" scripts (in version 0.7.0 it was happening before)](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/1efeb81)
* [detect panic and display a nice message asking the user to post details on github](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/80ddc06)

# v0.7.0 (2020-06-24)

This is a maintenance release:
- fixing a defect when starting a backup with no command definition for backup

# v0.6.0 (2020-04-07)

Complete rewrite of resticprofile in go:

* I tried python and I wasn't particularly impressed
* I tried go and I loved it (also that's what all the cool kids do nowadays)

The default configuration `profiles.conf` is still expected to be in TOML format. But now, resticprofile also supports YAML and JSON file format. Simply feed a `.toml`, `.json` or a `.yaml` file to select the desired format.

The configuration file from the previous versions remains unchanged. There are two additions to it:

* `priority` flags: acts like `nice` on unixes and now available on **all** platforms
* `lock` flag to avoid running two profiles at the same time (this is a *local* lock)


# v0.5.2 (2019-09-26)

Accept a repository from the environment instead of the configuration file

# v0.5.1 (2019-08-12)

- Add a timestamp before each message
- Use colours more readable on light console
- Add a flag to disable all ansi characters (to redirect the output to a file)


# v0.5.0 (2019-06-26)

Adds support for stdin file stream

# v0.4.1 Beta (2019-06-26)

- Adding 'mount' command support
- Allow chained inheritance of environment variables
- Allow inheritance on 'retention' section


# v0.4.0 Beta (2019-06-25)

- Removing ugly KeyboardInterrupt message when you hit CTRL-C
- Allow the host flag to be a boolean (if set to yes the current hostname will be used)
- Also search for restic binary under Windows (like the chocolatey bin folder)
- Adding two options to check repository before and/or after a backup: 'check-before' and 'check-after'
- Run shell commands before and after a backup: 'run-before' and 'run-after'


# v0.3.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

- Added "groups": ability to define groups of profiles to run at once


# v0.2.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

- Fixed compatibility with Windows
- Fixed defect in profile inheritance


# v0.1.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

First 'usable' version of resticprofile!

**Please note the groups are not working yet**
(groups can run multiple configuration in one command)
