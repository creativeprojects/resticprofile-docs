#### Section profile.**recover**

This section configures restic command `recover` .
Information on command and flags is copied from the [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) manual pages.

The "recover" command builds a new snapshot from all directories it can find in
the raw data of the repository which are not referenced in an existing snapshot.
It can be used if, for example, a snapshot has been removed by accident with "forget".

##### Flags used by **resticprofile** only:
